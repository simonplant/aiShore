    "sourceBacklog": "bugs.json",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: In cmd_init(), change the commented agent timeout from 600 to 3600 in the config template",
      "Step 2: In cmd_help(), add AISHORE_VALIDATE_CMD and AISHORE_VALIDATE_TIMEOUT to the env vars section",
      "Step 3: In product-owner.md, remove or clearly mark Review and Evolve mode sections as future/planned since the CLI only supports groom mode",
      "Step 4: In cmd_groom(), pass archive/sprints.jsonl as context when it exists (to match the product-owner.md prompt)",
      "Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md line count reference from ~1370 to something more durable like 'single file CLI' without a specific count"
    ],
    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "Config template in init shows correct default timeout of 3600",
      "Help text lists all 5 environment variables",
      "Product owner agent prompt only documents the groom mode (or clearly marks others as planned)",
      "Archive file is passed as context to groom when it exists",
      "No specific line count claims in documentation"
