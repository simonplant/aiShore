    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Remove all absolute-path entries that reference /home/simon/dev/aishore/",
      "Step 2: Replace them with relative-path equivalents where possible (e.g., .aishore/aishore help)",
      "Step 3: Remove the one-off git commit entry (line 19)",
      "Step 4: Review whether Bash(bash:*) is needed or if more specific permissions suffice",
      "Step 5: Remove one-off entries like Bash(while read f), Bash(do du -h), Bash(echo:*), Bash(awk:*) that were accumulated during development"

    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "No absolute paths in settings.local.json",
      "No one-off command entries",
      "Permissions are scoped to what the project actually needs",
      "File still allows the documented operations (shellcheck, git, aishore commands)"
