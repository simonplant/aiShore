      "Step 1: In cmd_run() argument parsing (line ~616-629), add --dry-run flag that sets local dry_run=false. Parse it in the case statement alongside --auto-commit.",
      "Step 2: In dry-run mode, skip acquire_lock() and stash logic (not needed since nothing is modified). Still call load_config() to show accurate config. Call pick_item() normally and display the selected item JSON with jq formatting.",
      "Step 3: Extract the prompt assembly logic from run_agent() (lines 549-556) into a helper function build_agent_prompt() that returns the assembled prompt string. In dry-run mode, call build_agent_prompt('developer', 'implement') and display the result.",
      "Step 4: Display the validation command ($VALIDATE_CMD) if configured, or note that no validation command is set.",
      "Step 5: Print a summary: 'Dry run complete. Would pick: <ITEM_ID> (<title>). Model: <MODEL_PRIMARY>. Validation: <VALIDATE_CMD or none>.' Exit 0 without starting any agent or modifying files.",
      "Step 6: Update cmd_help() to document --dry-run flag. Ensure --dry-run and --auto-commit can't both be set (log_error and exit if both specified)."
